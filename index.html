<p>
  <em class="bigg"> Ariana Grande Butera was born on the 26th of June 1993. As a young child she always wanted the spotlight and loved performing for other people. In 2009 she got the role of Cat Valentine in Victorious on Nickelodeon. During this time she loved to sing and had a few songs on the first Victorious soundtrack. Later on she wanted to focus on music rather than the show and released her first single called <strong>Put Your Hearts Up</strong> after being discovered by the CEO of Republic Records. Victorious was renewed for a second season and grande featured on the soundtrack for this season too which was called <strong>Victorious 2.0</strong>, and was released on June 5 2012. The third and final Victorious soundtrack, <strong>Victorious 3.0</strong>, was released on November 6, 2012. Nickelodeon created Sam & Cat, an iCarly and Victorious spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande. Grande and McCurdy reprised their respective roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom, which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business. The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the show was immediately picked up by the network. The following month, Nickelodeon doubled Sam & Cat's original 20-episode order for season one, making it a 40-episode season. Despite its success in the ratings, the series was canceled after 35 episodes. The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.
    Grande recorded her first studio album <strong>Yours Truly,</strong> originally titled Daydreamin' over a three-year period. It was released 30th of August 2013.
      Grande released her second studio album <strong>My Everything</strong> on August 25, 2014.
    Grande began recording songs for her third studio album, <strong>Dangerous Woman,</strong> originally titled Moonlight, in 2015. Grande released <strong>Dangerous Woman</strong> on May 20, 2016 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.
  On May 22, after her concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in the foyer of the arena, causing 23 fatalities and more than 500 injuries. Grande suspended the remainder of the tour and held a televised benefit concert One Love Manchester on June 4, helping to raise $23 million to aid the bombing victims and affected families. The concert featured performances from Grande, as well as Liam Gallagher, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and other artists. After the attack she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Anxiety.
    Grande began working on songs for her fourth studio album, <strong>Sweetener</strong>, with Pharrell Williams in 2016, but "the events in Manchester gave a hard reset to the project's expectations". Grande released "No Tears Left to Cry" as the lead single from <strong>Sweetener</strong> in April 2018, with the song debuting at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, making Grande the only artist to have debuted the first single from each of her first four albums in the top ten of the Hot 100. The second single, "God Is a Woman", peaked at number 8 on the Hot 100 and became Grande's tenth top ten single in the US.
    Released in August 2018, <strong>Sweetener </strong>debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.
    In November 2018, Grande released the single <strong>"Thank U, Next"</strong>and announced her fifth studio album of the same name.
    Grande became the first solo artist to occupy the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 with "7 Rings" at number one, her third single "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored" debuting at number two, and her lead single "Thank U, Next" rose to number three, and the overall second artist to do so since the Beatles did in 1964 when they occupied the top five spots.
    She then started the Sweetener World Tour, to promote both <strong>Sweetener</strong> and <strong>Thank U, Next,</strong> which began on March 18, 2019.
    In June 2019, Grande announced that she co-executive produced the soundtrack to <strong>Charlie's Angels</strong> along with Savan Kotecha, Ilya and Max Martin. A collaboration with Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey, titled "Don't Call Me Angel", was released as the lead single from the soundtrack on September 13, 2019. <br>

          In March 2017, Martinez expressed her wishes to produce a film telling the story of each song from her second album, explaining "I'm currently writing a film... I'm going to spend the year working on it, directing, shooting, make up and everything so it's a lot of work". On May 15, 2019, Martinez released the first teaser trailer for the album revealing the title <strong>K-12</strong>, released on September 6, with the album cover unveiled a day later through Instagram. While the film was available in select theaters worldwide, Martinez also posted the film to YouTube and included it in a version of the downloadable <strong>K-12 album.</strong> In an interview with PeopleTV, Melanie mentioned that she has two sequels and two visual albums planned to follow on from the <strong>K-12 album</strong> and film. She said, "I have my next film planned out, as far as I want to do, and the film after that and they both have albums attached to them. Hopefully the process will be faster this time and it won't be like four years because I've done it at least once and I've past all those learning curves that I had to kind of reach and figure out."
